I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida. I'm researching Data Visualization at Dr. Rosen's Visualization and Graphics lab. I'm highly interested in developing visualization tools that would help people understand their data better. I'm always looking for summer internship opportunities in Data Visualization, Software Engineering, and Data Science.

### Education
- PhD in Computer Science
  - University of South Florida(Aug 2021 - Present)
  - University of Arizona(Aug 2019 - Aug 2021)
- BS in Computer Science and Engineering
  - Khulna University of Engineering and Technology

I have 2 years of experience in Data Visualization. I have worked on a project that uses different javascript graph visualization libraries(d3.js, cola.js, dagre.js, Force Directed Graph, etc.) to visualize context-free grammars as node-link diagrams so that they can be understood and used easily by the users. As part of this project, I designed experiments and surveys to find out the requirements of the users for the visualization tool I was working on.

I have a strong background in Data Structures and Algorithms. My passion is solving problems, and I've been involved in competitive programming for more than six years. I've solved a lot of problems on various platforms(i.e. Codeforces, HackerRank, Leetcode, etc.). I'm proficient in Javascript, C++, Python, C, SQL and I have working experience in Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc.

I have always been a keen enthusiast of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. Every opportunity I have, I am learning more about these areas. I have been taking relevant graduate classes at USF and also taking online classes from various online learning platforms(i.e. Coursera, DataCamp, etc.). I am interested in integrating Machine Learning and Deep Learning into my Data Visualization research in the future.

Key Skills:
- Javascript, C++, C, Python, Java, PHP
- SQL, MySQL
- Linux, Shell Scripting
- Data Structure, Algorithms, Problem-solving
- Software Development, Database Design
- Data Visualization, Data Science, Deep Learning

I'm always looking for internship opportunities in Data Visualization, Data Science, and Software Engineering. I'm also enthusiastic about projects related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
