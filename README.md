I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida. I'm researching Data Visualization at Dr. Rosen's Visualization and Graphics lab. I'm highly interested in developing visualization tools that would help people understand their data better. I'm always looking for summer internship opportunities in Data Visualization, Software Engineering, and Data Science.
